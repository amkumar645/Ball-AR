# Ball-AR
Ball-AR is a two-player, co-located AR dodgeball game where users must hit the opponent 10 times with an augmented ball to win. Each user only gets one ball however, so after throwing it, they must go retrieve it in order to throw again. Also, users can ricochet the ball off physical surfaces, and are encouraged to as the more surfaces hit, the higher the score!.
